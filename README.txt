To create this project I began by first finding the data. The data I needed first was:
-the number of migrants from South Africa to other common destination countries
-the sectors in which these migrants were employed

I found the first piece of data from the United Nations (Source: http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml). I then filtered this data by origin country, South Africa, and cleared away any countries that had fewer than 200 migrants per year - so as to clean the data up. 

I then used CartoDB to visualize the migration flow of South Africans to destination countries over the course of 25 years (from 1990-2015). 

For the second piece of data, I found it on the OECD data base. I again had to filter by the origin country, South Africa, and then downloaded the filtered data onto an Excel spreadsheet. I took that data and converted it to a csv file so that I could make a chart on Infog.ram.org. 

I then used the OECD data base to collect the following statistics:

-the potential years of life lost per 100,000 inhabitants by year Source: https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/potential-years-of-life-lost.htm)

-the number of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants (from 2000-2013), Source: https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm

I then merged the number of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants sheet with a set of data that I found on the site, DataMarket, which collects data from the WorldBank. In this sheet, they provided data on the number of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants but it went as far back as 1960. Source: https://datamarket.com/data/set/1cgt/medical-doctors-per-1000-people#!ds=1cgt!r4l=19.1t.50.5f.65&display=line

From all the information and data that I had gathered, I used Infog.ram.org to organize it into simple and clean data visualizations (e.g. charts, line graphs, factoids).

Both the charts and the map that I had created on CartoDB were fed into the ArcGis platform for building stories, called MapStory. I added snippets of information that would help the reader understand the significance of the data laid out before them and arranged it in a way that would attract them upon first ‘click’.
